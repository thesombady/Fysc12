    "The purpose of this _jupyter_ notebook is to introduce data analysis tools, strategies and terminology used in gamma spectroscopy. The example programming language is _Python3_ , but of course most other coding languages can do the job properly as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never programmed before or are new to Python and would like to learn more, there are many great Python tutorials available across the web.\n",
    "There even exist plenty of _Open Online Courses_ , e.g.\n",
    "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python. Please have a look around for the one\n",
    "that you like the best. However, note that you do not need to be a\n",
    "Python programmer to pass the lab: the tool and code you will find in this notebook are enough for you to perform your own data analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis for these lab series can roughly be divided into four steps:\n",
    "1. Read experimental data from file.\n",
    "2. Identify peak positions.\n",
    "3. Calibrate the detector response.\n",
    "4. Perform a statistical analysis (e.g. error propagation) and present results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dedicated python library, i.e. a folder with already written code located in\n",
    "`lib`, has been implemented for this data analysis connected to your labs. This library will support you in above mentioned steps 1-3. This introduction notebook will introduce you to these library functions as well as their working principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section will consist of full Python3 coding examples of how to perform the different steps of the data\n",
    "analysis. Every example is finished with a template of how the\n",
    "analysis library can be used to perform the same calculations.\n"

To extract the energy of a given emission line (or use it for calibration puposes), the centroid of a peak must be determined. Area of the peak represents to the intensity of the radiation. A good way to find the peak centroid and area is to fit a Gaussian to the peak. \n",

Each time, the (squared) differences to the data are considered; once these are minimized, the algorithm returns the result to the user, typically with some additional statistical information that hints at the quality of the result.\n",
