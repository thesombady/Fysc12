    "* This 'Jupyter Notebook' is your manual, data analysis and log book all at the same time. It consists of individual cells of text or Python code and you can edit or add cells to your heart's content.\n",
    "* When using the notebook, there are two modes: *command* and *edit* mode. In command mode, you can add, move, run or delete cells. In edit mode, you modify its content. Use the *Esc* key or click outside the cell to leave edit mode. With *shift* + *return* you can run it directly from edit mode.\n",
    "* When you 'run' a cell it will either be formated or executed depending on whether it is a text cell or a code cell, respectivly. The output will be shown inside the notebook.\n",
    "* It is best to run the notebook piece-by-piece as we are progressing through the lab. If something doesn't work as expected, try 'Kernel->Restart' to get a fresh working environment.\n",
    "* Code cells support typical editing features of an IDE, such as tab-complete. You find more info in the 'Help' menu including all keyboard shortcuts!\n",
    "* **Please note**: The code is not supposed to work out-of-the-box but needs some tweaks from your side to complete all the way through! So if you encounter an error, don't despair, try to fix it and ask for help should you get stuck!"
